 BUILD ARTIFACTS (Auto-Generated - Don't Edit)
Folders to NEVER manually edit:

dist/ - Contains your built .exe (auto-generated)
build/ - Build cache (auto-generated)
__pycache__/ - Python cache (auto-generated)
tests/ - Test files (safe to modify, but not needed for basic changes)

Files that are auto-generated:

build_full_mixed.txt - Build log/output
enhanced_config.env - Generated config
Anything in dist/ or build/

🚫 HANDS OFF (Will Break Things)

Never edit files in dist/ - Your .exe lives there
Never edit files in build/ - PyInstaller cache
Don't manually edit __pycache__ - Python cache
Don't edit .pyc files - Compiled Python

🔄 Your Workflow
